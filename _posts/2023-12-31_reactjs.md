### 1. React Hooks 
#### useState:
    - to declare a state variable
    - can be called only at the top level, not inside any loops/conditions
    
#### Syntax: 
 ```js
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
```

```js 
functionTodoList(){
const[todos,setTodos]= useState(createInitialTodos());
// ...
```
##### 
Result of createInitialTodos() is only used during initial render, but function call happens on every render. To avoid this, pass the function instead of calling/invoking the function. React will call this function only during initialization.

##### Initializer function:
```js 
functionTodoList(){ 
	const[todos,setTodos]= useState(createInitialTodos);
	// …
```

#### useEffect:
	- Synchronize a component with external system( API / third party library)
	- Can be called only at the top level, not inside any loops/conditions
	
```js 
useEffect(setup, dependencies?)
```
	
- Re render happens only when dependency changes after its initial setup during mount
- Clean up code runs when it unmounts
- Every reactive value must be declared as a dependency
- Never assigned to a variable

> External ( any code that's not controlled by React)

>> A timer managed with setInterval() and clearInterval().
>> An event subscription using window.addEventListener() and window.removeEventListener().
>> A third-party animation library with an API like animation.start() and animation.reset().

If you’re not connecting to any external system, you probably don’t need an Effect.
